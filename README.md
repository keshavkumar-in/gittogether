# CI/CD Pipeline Project

This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment of a web application to either Netlify or Vercel.

```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ci-cd-pipeline-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application locally:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- Modify the `src/index.html`, `src/styles.css`, and `src/app.js` files to develop your web application.
- Use the scripts defined in `package.json` for building and testing your application.

## Deployment

- The application can be deployed to either Netlify or Vercel. Ensure that the appropriate configuration file (`netlify.toml` or `vercel.json`) is set up based on your preferred platform.
- The CI/CD pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` will automatically handle the deployment process upon pushing changes to the main branch.
